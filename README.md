ðŸŒ± **From Curiosity to Code**

It started with a single curiosity: _"How do websites really work?"_ That question led me down a path of building scalable systems, solving real-world problems, and leading development on platforms used by thousands daily.

With over **2 years of hands-on experience**, Iâ€™ve worked across the full stack â€” from crafting responsive UIs in Angular to designing backend APIs in Laravel and deploying on AWS. Iâ€™m driven by **clean code**, **smart automation**, and the power of **AI integrations** to deliver smarter user experiences.
